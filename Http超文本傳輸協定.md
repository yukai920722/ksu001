## HTTP

- [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
- [超文本傳輸協定](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
  - HTTP是一種用於分佈式、協作式和超媒體訊息系統的`應用層`協定


## HTTP Request

###
- CRLF refers to the special character elements "Carriage Return" and "Line Feed." 
- These elements are embedded in HTTP headers and other software code to signify an End of Line (EOL) marker. 
- Many internet protocols, including MIME (e-mail), NNTP (newsgroups) and, more importantly, HTTP, use CRLF sequences to split text streams into discrete elements. 
- Web application developers split HTTP and other headers based on where CRLF is located. 
- CRLF injection attack ==> Exploits occur when an attacker is able to inject a CRLF sequence into an HTTP stream.
